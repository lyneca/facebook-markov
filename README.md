# Facebook Messenger Markov Generator
Generates Markov chains and 'new' messages from your Facebook friends

## Usage
1. Download your Facebook data from [Facebook](https://facebook.com) - it's under settings.
2. Find `messages.htm` and put it in the same directory as these files.
3. `pip install markovify`
3. Edit `conversation.py` and put **full names** (i.e. as they appear on Facebook) in the `names` list.
4. Run `conversation.py` and hope that it works! If not, make an issue!

# Credits
All the Markov stuff was done by the excellent [`markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) library.
